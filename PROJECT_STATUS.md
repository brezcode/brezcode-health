- **ai_training_sessions:** AI training data with conversation history
- **health_reports:** Personalized health reports with analytics
- **user_preferences:** User settings and notification preferences

**3. ✅ Production API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/quiz/submit` - Save quiz results to PostgreSQL database
- `GET /api/quiz/:sessionId` - Retrieve quiz results from database
- `POST /direct-api/training/start` - Create AI training sessions (database-backed)
- `POST /direct-api/training/:sessionId/continue` - Continue AI conversations (persistent)
- `POST /direct-api/training/:sessionId/stop` - Complete training sessions (saved to database)

**4. ✅ Enhanced AI System with Database Persistence:**
- **Real Claude Sonnet 4:** Latest Anthropic model for avatar responses
- **OpenAI Fallback:** GPT-4o backup for high availability  
- **Database Storage:** All AI conversations saved to PostgreSQL
